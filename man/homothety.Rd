\usage{
homothety(x, y, lambda, xcen = NULL, ycen = NULL, add = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x, y}{the x and ycoordinates of points. It can also be a matrix (see
details).}

\item{lambda}{the factor to be used for the homothetetic transformations.}

\item{xcen, ycen}{the x and y coordinate for the center of rotation.}

\item{add}{logical. If \code{TRUE} the set of transformed points are drawn as a polygon.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to \code{\link[graphics:polygon]{graphics::polygon()}} function (used only if \code{add} is TRUE).}
}
\description{
Compute a homothetic transformation for a set of points.
The transformed set of points is optionally drawn as a polygon.
}
\details{
If \code{x} is a matrix with more than 2 columns, then \code{x} is the first column and y the second one.

Note that \code{lambda}, \code{xcen} and \code{ycen} are unique, meaning that \code{homothety} computes only one homothetic transformation.
Drawing the points computed is relevant only if there are more than 2 points.
}
\examples{
# Example:
plot0(c(0, 10), c(0, 10))
x <- c(4, 6, 5)
y <- c(2, 2, 4)
polygon(x, y)
poly2 <- homothety(x, y, 2)
polygon(poly2$x, poly2$y)
poly3 <- homothety(x, y, -2.5, xcen = 5, ycen = 4, border = 4, add = TRUE)
