compassRose(
  x = 0,
  y = 0,
  labels = c("S", "W", "N", "E"),
  rot = 0,
  cex.cr = 1,
  cex.let = cex.cr,

  x,
  y = x,
  rot = 0,
  cex.cr = 1,

\arguments{
\item{x, y}{the x and y coordinates of the center of the compass rose.}

\item{labels}{a vector of four character strings used as labels for the
cardinal directions.}

\item{rot}{rotation for the compass rose in degrees (clockwise).}

\item{cex.cr}{the magnification to be used for the whole compass rose.}

\item{cex.let}{the magnification to be used for labels.}

\item{col.cr}{a vector of colors used to draw compass rose (see details).}

\item{col.let}{a character string specifying the labels' color.}

\item{border}{a vector of colors of the borders of the compass rose.}

\item{offset}{label offset of the cardinal points.}

\item{add}{a logical. Should the compass rose be added on the current graph?}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to \code{\link[graphics:polygon]{graphics::polygon()}}.}
}
\description{
This function draws a fully personnalisable compass rose.
}
\details{
Both \code{col.cr} and \code{border} are repeated over (\code{\link[base:rep]{base::rep()}}
is called) so it has a 8 elements, meaning all triangles the compass rose is
made of could have their own color.

Note that there already exists a similar function by Jim Lemon in \code{sp}
package.
