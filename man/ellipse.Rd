\usage{
ellipse(
  x = 0,
  y = x,
  mjradi = 1,
  mnradi = 0.5,
  from = 0,
  to = 2 * pi,
  rot = 0,
  incr = 0.01,
  pie = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the x coordinates of the centers of the ellipses.}

\item{y}{same as \code{x} for the y-axis.}

\item{mjradi}{the major radii of the ellipses.}

\item{mnradi}{the minor radii of the ellipses.}

\item{from}{the angles, expressed in radians, from which ellipses are drawn.}

\item{to}{the angles, expressed in radians, to which ellipses are drawn.}

\item{rot}{the rotation angles (in degree) of the ellipses.}

\item{incr}{increments between two points to be linked (expressed in
radians).}

\item{pie}{a logical. If \code{TRUE} end points are linked with the center of
the ellipse (default is set to \code{FALSE}).}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to \code{\link[graphics:polygon]{graphics::polygon()}}.}
}
\description{
Draw ellipses in a flexible way.
}
\details{
For a rotation angle of 0, major radii refer to the one along the x axis.
The number of circles drawn is given by the maximum argument length among
\code{x}, \code{y}, \code{radi}, \code{from} and \code{to} arguments. Note vector length are adjusted
using \code{\link[=rep_len]{rep_len()}}.
}
\note{
There is a similar function, called \code{draw.ellipse}, in the package \code{plotrix}.

\examples{
# Example 1:
plot0(asp = 1)
ellipse()

# Example 2:
plot0()
for (i in seq(0, 360, 30)) ellipse(rot = i)

# Example 3:
plot0()
ellipse(matrix(-.5 + .5 * stats::runif(18), ncol = 3))

# Example 4:
plot0(x = c(-2, 2), y = c(-2, 2), asp = 1)
ellipse(
    x = c(-1, 1), c(1, 1, -1, -1), from = pi * seq(0.25, 1, by = 0.25),
    to = 1.25 * pi, col = 2, border = 4, lwd = 3
