\usage{
arrows2(
  x0,
  y0,
  x1 = x0,
  y1 = y0,
  off0 = 0,
  off1 = off0,
  cex.arr = 1,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x0}{the x coordinates of points from which to draw arrows.}

\item{y0}{the y coordinates of points from which to draw arrows.}

\item{x1}{the x coordinates of points to which to draw arrows.}

\item{y1}{the y coordinates of points to which to draw arrows.}

\item{off0}{offset of points from which to draw arrows.}

\item{off1}{offset of points to which to draw arrows.}

\item{cex.arr}{the magnification coefficient to be used for the heights of
the arrows.}

\item{cex.shr}{the magnification coefficient to be used to change the
height of arrows towards their heads.}

\item{cex.hh}{the magnification coefficient to be used for the heights of
arrows' head.}

\item{cex.hl}{the magnification coefficient to be used for the lengths of
arrows' head.}

\item{prophead}{logical. If \code{TRUE} arrows are drawn with head proportional
to the length of the arrows.}

\item{twoheaded}{logical. If \code{TRUE} two-headed arrows are drawn, default is
\code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{additional arguments to be passed to \code{polygon} function.}
}
\description{
Draw a custom arrows between pairs of points.
